          Boneless, skinless chicken breast, again? Amp up the flavor of your
          chicken with bacon! These are butterflied: either do it yourself or
          ask your butcher to do it for you. You can then stuff them with cheese
          and asparagus, wrap them up in a bacon blanket, and air fry! While
          they cook, toss a green salad, add a veggie or potato, and some bread,
          and you'll be enjoying your dinner in no time.

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            3 breast half, bone and skin removed (blank)s skinless, boneless
            chicken breasts
          </li>
          <li>1 teaspoon lemon-pepper seasoning, or to taste</li>
          <li>3 slices Monterey Jack cheese</li>
          <li>6 spears fresh asparagus</li>
          <li>9 slices bacon /li></li>
          <li>12 each wooden toothpicks</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Preheat the air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) if
            recommended by manufacturer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pat chicken pieces dry with paper towels. Use a sharp knife slice
            horizontally through the middle, beginning at the thickest part,
            being careful not to cut all the way through to the other side. Open
            the 2 sides and spread them out like an open book.
          </li>
          <li>
            Season both sides with lemon-pepper seasoning. Place 1 slice of
            cheese on each chicken breast. Cut asparagus spears in half and
            place 4 halves on top of the cheese. Roll the chicken up and over
            the cheese and asparagus, keeping the stuffing inside each roll.
            Wrap each chicken breast with 3 pieces of bacon, using wooden
            toothpicks to secure the bacon, where it overlaps.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place each bacon-wrapped breast in the air fryer basket and air fry
            for 15 minutes. Turn and cook for 15 minutes more. Test chicken for
            doneness; an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center
            should reach 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
          </li>
